How to compile and run your program
- there is a main function in Game.java
- users can run the game by using Game.java

Any assumptions
- if the pawn makes it to the end of the row then it can change to any piece except pawn or king
- if the king gets killed then the game ends

Any known bugs or defects in the program
- The spacing for numbers on top of the board could be different for mac and windows and that is the only bug that we have.
